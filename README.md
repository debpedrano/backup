# Backup
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stevesoltys/backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stevesoltys/backup)

A backup application for the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/).

## Features
- Backup application data to a zip file.
- Restore application data from a zip file.

## Getting Started
- Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/stevesoltys/backup/wiki) for information on building the application with 
AOSP.

## What makes this different?
This application is compiled with the operating system and does not require a rooted device for use. It uses the same 
internal APIs as `adb backup` and only requires one permission: `android.permission.BACKUP`.
